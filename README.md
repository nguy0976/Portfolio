## I designed and planned to build my website to show what I have learned and can do from my experiences. And my design has depended on my taste and the look I want on the website I build for myself.
### It took me 5 days to learn and how to create a website for myself. And during the implementation I encountered a lot of problems on how to solve the problems for my website. I had a lot of problems with Flex elements to get it to work properly and have a nice layout for my site. I had to learn a lot about it and review the lectures in class to solve the problems I had.This is one of the difficulties that I have to face:
- Flexbox
- Layout
- Text on image
### But since then I've drawn a lot of experience and re-learned what I'd forgotten, I've mastered the Flex problems for molecules and made it work the way I wanted it to. And I have learned a lot of experiences and lessons after solving my own problems and the problems that i solved are:
- [x] Flexbox
- [x] Layout
- [x] Text on image
